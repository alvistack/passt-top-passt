Description: User-mode networking daemons for virtual machines and namespaces
 passt implements a translation layer between a Layer-2 network interface
 and native Layer-4 sockets (TCP, UDP, ICMP/ICMPv6 echo) on a host. It
 doesn't require any capabilities or privileges, and it can be used as a
 simple replacement for Slirp.
 .
 pasta (same binary as passt, different command) offers equivalent
 functionality, for network namespaces: traffic is forwarded using a tap
 interface inside the namespace, without the need to create further
 interfaces on the host, hence not requiring any capabilities or
 privileges.
